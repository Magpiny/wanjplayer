# WanjPlayer Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the critical improvements implemented to fix segmentation faults, enhance playlist functionality, improve the status bar, and add collapsible playlist support for fullscreen video experience.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Segmentation Fault Fixes ✅
**Problem**: Application crashed with segmentation faults when clicking Next/Previous buttons, especially at playlist boundaries or with empty playlists.

**Root Causes**:
- Missing null pointer checks for media control and playlist objects
- No bounds validation when navigating playlist
- Lack of error handling in navigation methods
- Index out-of-bounds errors during playlist operations

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive safety checks in all navigation methods
- Implemented try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Added proper bounds validation before accessing playlist items
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- Protected all media control operations with null pointer checks

**Files Modified**:
- `src/media_ctrls.cpp` - Added safety checks to OnNext/OnPrevious handlers
- `src/playlist.cpp` - Enhanced all navigation methods with bounds checking
- `include/media_ctrls.hpp` - Updated method signatures for better error handling

### 2. Enhanced Status Bar System ✅
**Problem**: Status bar only showed basic volume and playback rate information, no file details or duration.

**Requirements**: Display filename, duration in HH:MM:SS format, and relevant playback info across 4 columns.

**Implementation**:
```
Column Layout:
[0: System Messages] [1: Filename] [2: Duration HH:MM:SS] [3: Playback Status]
```

**Features Added**:
- **Column 0**: System logging messages and operational status
- **Column 1**: Current filename (auto-truncated for long names, max 40 chars)
- **Column 2**: Track duration formatted as HH:MM:SS
- **Column 3**: Real-time playback status (Playing/Paused/Stopped/Finished)
- **Real-time Updates**: Status bar updates automatically during playback
- **Smart Formatting**: Duration converts milliseconds to readable HH:MM:SS format

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/statusbar.cpp` - Complete rewrite with 4-column layout and formatting
- `include/statusbar.hpp` - New methods for file info and duration display
- `src/media_events.cpp` - Integrated status bar updates with media events
- `src/wanjplayer.cpp` - Updated status bar initialization

### 3. Collapsible Playlist ✅
**Problem**: Playlist always visible, preventing fullscreen video experience.

**Requirements**: Make playlist hideable for distraction-free video viewing.

**Implementation**:
- **Toggle Button**: "Hide Playlist" / "Show Playlist" button in playlist panel
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: F9 key toggles playlist visibility
- **Menu Option**: View → Toggle Playlist menu item
- **State Management**: Tracks playlist visibility state
- **Status Integration**: Shows fullscreen mode status in status bar

**Technical Details**:
- Uses `wxSplitterWindow::Unsplit()` to hide playlist
- Uses `wxSplitterWindow::SplitVertically()` to restore playlist
- Maintains splitter reference for dynamic control
- Updates button label and status bar message based on state
- Preserves video playback during playlist toggle operations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/wanjplayer.cpp` - Added splitter reference and toggle button
- `include/wanjplayer.hpp` - Added playlist_visible state tracking
- `src/media_events.cpp` - Implemented OnTogglePlaylist handler
- `src/menubar.cpp` - Added View menu with F9 shortcut

### 4. Complete Playlist System Overhaul ✅
**Problem**: Playlist items not clickable, no auto-advance, broken Next/Previous functionality.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Enhanced Playlist Management:
- **Current Track Tracking**: Added `current_index` to track active item
- **Visual Highlighting**: Current track highlighted in playlist
- **Click Navigation**: Double-click any item to play it immediately
- **Auto-advance**: Automatically plays next track when current finishes
- **Keyboard Controls**: Space to play, Delete to remove items

#### Smart Navigation Methods:
```cpp
play_next_item_in_queue()     - Safe navigation to next track
play_previous_item_in_queue() - Safe navigation to previous track  
play_item_at_index(index)     - Direct track selection
has_next() / has_previous()   - Boundary checking
```

#### Robust Error Handling:
- Comprehensive bounds checking on all operations
- Graceful handling of empty playlists
- Error recovery for failed media loading
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

**Files Modified**:
- `src/playlist.cpp` - Complete rewrite with proper track management
- `include/playlist.hpp` - Added navigation methods and state tracking

### 5. Advanced Media Controls ✅
**Problem**: Basic controls with limited functionality and no duration tracking.

**Enhancements Implemented**:

#### Real-time Duration System:
- **Timer-based Updates**: 1-second interval timer for live updates
- **Position Tracking**: Real-time playback position display
- **Seek Functionality**: Click position slider to jump to any location
- **Duration Display**: Current time / total time in mm:ss format
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual progress bar with 1000-point precision

#### Enhanced Control Layout:
```
Row 1: [Current Time] [====Progress Slider====] [/] [Total Time]
Row 2: [Prev] [Play] [Pause] [Stop] [Next]    Volume: [====]
```

#### Smart Timer Management:
- Automatic timer startup with media controls
- Proper cleanup in destructor
- Safe updates with null pointer checking
- Handles media duration changes dynamically

**Files Modified**:
- `src/media_ctrls.cpp` - Complete rewrite with timer system and enhanced layout
- `include/media_ctrls.hpp` - Added timer, duration tracking, and layout components

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Management & Safety
- **Null Pointer Validation**: All media operations check object validity
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks around critical operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper timer and object destruction
- **Bounds Checking**: Array access always validated before use

### Event System Architecture
```cpp
Media Events Flow:
OnMediaLoaded() → Update duration & status bar → Start timer
OnMediaPlay() → Update status → Enable position tracking
OnMediaFinished() → Auto-advance → Update playlist position
OnMediaStop() → Reset position → Update status display
```

### State Management
- **Playlist State**: current_index, playlist_visible, item_count
- **Media State**: duration, position, playback_status
- **UI State**: timer_active, controls_visible, slider_values
- **Error State**: last_error, recovery_attempts, safe_mode

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Updates**: Only refresh changed UI elements
- **Timer Optimization**: 1-second intervals balance responsiveness with CPU usage
- **Smart Refreshing**: Conditional updates based on actual state changes
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when operations fail

## Testing & Verification

### Test Coverage
- **Segfault Prevention**: Stress tested with rapid button clicking and boundary conditions
- **Status Bar Updates**: Verified real-time updates during playback and navigation
- **Playlist Toggle**: Tested all three toggle methods (button, F9, menu)
- **Error Handling**: Tested with empty playlists, invalid files, and edge cases
- **Memory Safety**: No memory leaks detected in timer and media operations

### Test Scripts Provided
- `test_improvements.sh` - Comprehensive functionality testing
- `test_playlist.sh` - Playlist-specific feature testing  
- `run_safe_video.sh` - Video playback with GStreamer fixes
