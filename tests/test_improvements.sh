WANJPLAYER COMPREHENSIVE TEST INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================

IMPORTANT: Test these features in order to verify all improvements work correctly.

1. BASIC LOADING TEST:
   - Start WanjPlayer
   - Go to File → Open Files (Ctrl+Shift+O)
   - Select ALL the test audio files from this directory
   - Verify playlist loads and first track starts playing

2. STATUS BAR VERIFICATION:
   - Check bottom status bar has 4 columns:
     [System Message] [Filename] [Duration HH:MM:SS] [Status]
   - Verify filename appears in column 1
   - Verify duration appears as HH:MM:SS in column 2
   - Verify status shows "Playing" in column 3
   - System messages should appear in column 0

3. PLAYLIST NAVIGATION STRESS TEST (Segfault Fix):
   - Click Next button rapidly 10 times → Should not crash
   - Click Previous button rapidly 10 times → Should not crash
   - Navigate to last track, click Next → Should handle gracefully
   - Navigate to first track, click Previous → Should handle gracefully
   - Try with empty playlist → Should not crash

4. COLLAPSIBLE PLAYLIST TEST:
   - Click "Hide Playlist" button → Playlist should disappear
   - Status bar should show "Playlist hidden - fullscreen video mode"
   - Button should change to "Show Playlist"
   - Press F9 key → Should toggle playlist visibility
   - Use View → Toggle Playlist menu → Should also toggle
   - Click "Show Playlist" → Playlist should reappear

5. COMPREHENSIVE PLAYBACK TEST:
   - Double-click different playlist items → Should play immediately
   - Use position slider → Should seek within track
   - Let track finish → Should auto-advance to next
   - Pause/Resume → Status should update accordingly
   - Change volume → Should work smoothly

6. ERROR HANDLING TEST:
   - Remove files from playlist (Delete key)
   - Try to play with empty playlist
   - Navigate beyond playlist bounds
   - All operations should be safe and logged properly

Expected Results:
- NO segmentation faults or crashes
- Smooth playlist navigation
- Real-time status bar updates
- Responsive playlist toggle
- Proper error handling and logging

If any test fails, check console output for error messages.
