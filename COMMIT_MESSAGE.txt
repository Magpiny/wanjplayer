feat: Overhaul of the Player's visual state and build process

This commit introduces several fixes and improvements to the UI and build process.

Player Animation State:
The player canvas now correctly reflects the playback state:
- An idle animation is displayed when the application is launched, when media is stopped, or when a playlist finishes.
- The audio waveform visualization is now correctly paused when playback is paused and resumes when playback continues.
- Previously, the visualization would continue animating when paused, and would not switch to the idle screen when a playlist ended.

Application Icon:
- The application icon loading has been made more robust. It now uses a `wxIconBundle` with multiple icon sizes (16, 32, 64, 256px) to ensure correct display on various X11 window managers and desktop environments.
- The logic for finding the assets directory is now more resilient, checking both the current and parent directories.
- A redundant `wxSetEnv` call was also removed.

Build Process:
- A build failure was resolved by moving `sidebar.hpp` from the `src/` directory to the `include/` directory, making the header file locations consistent.
