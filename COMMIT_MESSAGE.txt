fix: update GitHub Actions to v4 to resolve deprecation warnings

Updated all deprecated v3 actions to v4:
- actions/checkout@v3 → actions/checkout@v4
- actions/cache@v3 → actions/cache@v4
- actions/upload-artifact@v3 → actions/upload-artifact@v4

This resolves the CI failure caused by GitHub's deprecation of v3
artifact actions as announced in April 2024.
